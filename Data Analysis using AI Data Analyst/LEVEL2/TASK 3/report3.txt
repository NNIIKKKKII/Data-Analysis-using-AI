The task involves enhancing the dataset through feature engineering by extracting new features, such as calculating the length of restaurant names and addresses. Additionally, it includes encoding categorical variables like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" into binary values (1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No"). These steps aim to provide more quantitative data for analysis and modeling.

The analysis involves visualizing restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude data, which requires the folium library to create an interactive map. Since folium is not available in the current environment, instructions are provided for performing this task locally. This includes installing folium, creating an interactive map, and saving it as an HTML file to view in a web browser. Alternatively, a static scatter plot using matplotlib is suggested for a basic visualization of restaurant locations. The goal is to understand the geographical distribution of restaurants and analyze any correlation between their locations and ratings.
